INTERNET OF THINGS

Many of us have dreamed of Smart homes where our appliances do our bidding
automatically. 

The alarm sounds and the coffee pot starts brewing the moment you want to
start your day. Lights come on as you walk through the house. Some
unseen computing device responds to your voice commands to read your
schedule and messages to you while you get ready, then turns on the
TV news. Your car drives you to work via the least congested route,
freeing you up to get caught up on your reading or prep for your
morning meeting while in transit.

We've read and seen such things in science fiction for decades, but they're
now either already possible or on the brink of coming into being. And
all this new tech is forming the basis of what people are calling the
Internet of Things.

Billions of connected devices are part of the Internet of Things. They use
built-in hardware and software to send and receive data via various
communication protocols. They might use our smartphones as their
gateway to the Internet, connect to some other piece of hardware in
our homes that's acting as a hub or connect directly through our home
Internet service. They often send data to cloud
computing servers
where it's then aggregated and analyzed. We can usually access the
results via apps or browsers on our mobile devices or home computers.
Some can even be set up to update your status on various social
networks.

At the moment, a lot of connected devices can talk to the Internet and
to our phones, and maybe even some related products, but most of them
can't talk to one another because of proprietary hardware and
software with differing standards, languages and communication
protocols. For most of the current remotely controlled smart
household items, you'll need to use a different app or website to
interface with the device or look at the data, unless they were
specifically designed by the manufacturer to work together. In other
words, the alarm clock talking to the coffee pot isn't easily
achievable just yet unless you are an electronics hobbyist or the
same company makes smart versions of them.

There aren't any universal standards or platforms to allow seamless interaction
between all smart gadgets and enable you to control them from a
central app, but several groups are working on creating standard
protocols and software to make interoperability of multiple devices
from different manufacturers a reality.

DEVICES IN IOT( Internet Of Things)_

The devices that contribute to the Internet of Things span personal,
household, public, business and industrial spaces, and any area
that's not affected by them now likely will be in the future. The
smart gadgets that many of us see and interact with daily are our
Internet-connected smartphones, which have sensors including
accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS and sometimes heart-rate monitors,
but those are just the tip of the iceberg.

In the personal-item sphere, we have wearable devices like fitness trackers
and heart monitors that use our phones to send and receive data.
Smartwatches, like Apple Watch and Pebble, perform those tasks and
many more in conjunction with our phones. Sensors and microprocessors
on clothing aren't far behind (and are possible to create now with
sewable boards and sensors from Arduino and other companies). Even
pets can be added to the list of "things" we can add
sensors to for tracking purposes. We also already have cameras that
send pictures to the Internet, scales that can share our weight on
social media, toothbrushes that monitor our brushing habits and
gaming systems that listen for verbal commands.

Security and Privacy Concerns;

A lot of us perform monetary transactions and place loads of information
about ourselves online, so we're probably aware that there's data
about us floating around in the cloud. But now our inanimate objects
are starting to generate and transmit even more information about our
daily lives, raising both privacy and security concerns.

Already the analysis of big data is used to target us with appropriate ads,
and connected devices like our phones enable the ads to follow us
around, alerting us to deals as we're nearing a particular store, for
instance. Data is also used to discover things about us, like our
purchasing and traveling patterns, our income levels and our health
status.
