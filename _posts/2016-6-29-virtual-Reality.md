VIRTUAL REALITY

Benefits and Dangers of Virtual Reality   
  
  
Although still in its, infancy, virtual reality will have a substantial effect
on our future way of life. Virtual reality already has made
astounding progress in the world of commercial design, and it is
predicted to have a tremendous impact on everyday life as
well.virtualReality,
when more available, will have various uses ranging from recreation
to basic communication. The applications of virtual reality into
different fields of occupations and research will have both positive
and negative effects on our society.   
  
Virtual reality can be defined as a, "technology that enables users to
enter computer generated worlds and interface with them three
dimensionally through sight, sound, and touch" (Newquist 93).
Virtual reality combines computer simulation and visualization
into a single, coherent whole (Peterson 8). Researchers say it
embodies an attempt to eliminate the traditional distinction between
the user and the machine. Virtual reality is intended to provide a
means of naturally and intelligently interacting with information
(8). Virtual reality is contending to be the interface of the future,
allowing ordinary users to use their senses to interact with complex
data.   
  
Virtual reality is a new exploration in science and technology using advanced
and complex mechanics. Virtual reality allows for users to go far
beyond simply looking at a computer screen. Instead, the user puts on
a special suit or gloves equipped with fiber-optic sensors. These
fiber-optic sensors are able to interpret body positions. The user
also wears special goggles that have video screens and audio
attachments. This equipment allows for the user's complete immersion
into a 3-D, computer generated, model of reality (Carr 37). The use
of a two-way data transfer is what enables this interaction with an
alternate reality to occur. Fiber-optic and electronic cables are
attached to the virtual reality equipment in order to record the
user's movements (Newquist 93). These cables then send this
information, called motion data, to workstations which modifies the
graphics in the model. The new information is then sent back to the
users headset, displaying a graphic and audio world that is time with
his or her movements. It is because of this cabling process that the
action/reaction information is continually updated (93).   
  
In order to effectively create a 3-D environment for the user, virtual
reality combines the elements of immersion and interactivity.
Immersion is the user's contact with the virtual reality with as many
senses as possible including; sight, hearing, and touch. The degree
of an individual's immersion into an alternate world depends on how
many senses are in contact with the virtual reality equipment.
Interactivity includes the concept that the user can move around,
touch things, and talk in this virtual environment (Carr 39).
Together these factors make possible the effect of a completely
realistic atmosphere.   
  
Virtual reality has reached far beyond the interest of only computer
scientists and engineers. It has also peaked interest in many other
fields including; communication and telecommunication industrialists,
artists, the entertainment industry, the medical field, the military,
and major businesses and industries. While once believed to excel in
mainly forms of entertainment, namely high-tech video games, virtual
reality is rapidly becoming an advanced means for communication.
Virtual reality technology allows for users to observe and access
information in a number of ways. It is this aspect that is
increasingly appealing to large businesses and corporations. Virtual
reality, once perfected, will have widespread use in these particular
fields.   
  
Almost all advances in technology have an impact on society at large, and
virtual reality is definitely one of them. Virtual reality will have
major effects, both positive and negative, on our society in the
future. While presently only in the beginning stages, virtual reality
could change our future  way of life drastically.   
  
Some of the positive implications of virtual reality will be used in order
to prevent mistake or practice trial and error. For example, in the
medical field simulated surgery would serve in the training of new
doctors and medical students. Experimentation with new procedures on
simulated patients could become possible as well. In the military the
use of flight simulators has been a practice for years. The use of
virtual reality would provide even more advanced, realistic
situations for military training in flight as well as in combat.
Virtual reality in businesses and corporations would provide
tremendous means of communication and equal access to data. For
example, rather than search through file cabinets on a computer
desktop, the user will be able to actually open the file drawers and
flip through the files his or her self (Carr 40).   
  
There are also several drawbacks to this technological advance and its
foretold widespread incorporation into our society. The present cost
and the complications with the virtual reality equipment are two of
the main negatives facing scientists. For example, the head set
sometimes cannot keep up with the natural movements of the user's
head. The issue of dehumanization in our society is a another
negative aspect. It is essential to our existence that we maintain a
humanistic mindset and not become overrun by a technology immersed
world. Virtual reality, if as widespread as predicted, could result
in a significant decrease in human interaction in the real world.
It's advantageous for building stronger companies and so on; but what
will our society turn into if everyone is walking around in goggles
and gloves pretending they are somewhere that doesn't even
exist?   
  
In addition, virtual reality defeats the traditional view that fantasy
is unattainable. In a way fantasy and what we cannot obtain is
intrinsic to our existence. People may begin to spend more and more
time in their preferred "virtual or fantasy world" and less
time in reality. One researcher says that if, "people eventually
use virtual reality technology for the same amount of time that they
spend watching TV and using computers, some users could end up
spending more than twenty years inside virtual reality" (Biocca
14). If we begin to lose our hold on distinguishing between fantasy
and reality, our entire world will become uncertain. While virtual
reality is a colossal accomplishment in the science world, there must
be some limitations on its incorporation into our society.
