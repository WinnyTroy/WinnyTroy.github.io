Blockchain: the single most confusing term since Bitcoin.

 The Blockchain is a public ledger where transactions are recorded and confirmed anonymously.

 

 It is a record of events that is shared between many parties. And most importantly;

    ``once information is entered, It cannot be altered.

    

Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are currencies that exist solely in digital.

N.B there are over 12 other crypocurrency alternatives to bitcoin ie

            1. Litecoin                                                 7.Quark

            2.Peercoin                                                 8.Freicoin

            3.Primecoin                                             9.Mastercoin

            4.Namecoin                                            10.Nxt

            5.RIpple                                                     11.Auroracoin

            6.Sexcoin                                                  12.Dogecoin

            

Moreover, owning these non-real coins entails a new idea of “ownership.”

You dont need to have it literally in your arms, or even in your bank account. BUt,

the ability to transfer ownership to someone else, simply by creating a record in the blockchain.

Now, due to the open nature of cryptocurrencies, and the importance of the public having access to other blocks;

the blockchain isnt located on one guy's computer

E.g     -the bitcoin blockchain is actually managed by distributed nodes. 

            -These nodes all have a copy of the entire blockchain. 

            -Nodes will forever come and go, synchronizing their own copies of the chain with those of other users

            

By distributing these copies, the chain just doesn 'go down/disappear'...Its a decentralised system

It is both sturdy and secure

It gives alot of opportunities and functionality to the user. 

        

        Now, There are many reasons people are falling in love with cryptocurrencies: 

        it’s anonymous, decentralized, and there are no fees or third parties trying to grab a percentage.


What you can actually do with these bitcoins falls under 3 catergories:
You can accept and trade coins, or you can mine for them.

Miners, solve problems ie they collect transactionns and put them into a sinle block.

A block generally contains 4 pieces of info:

                    1. A reference to the previous block

                    2. A summary included transaction

                    3. A time stamp

                    4. Proof of work

                    

These blocks are then strung together into a chain- a fluid chain that does not allow for any inconsistencies

Some inconsistencies could cause some questions to be raised ie

                1. Could some kid cooped up in a garage confirm a billion dollar transfer?

                    -Blocks generally need numerous independent confirmations, and the equations are intended to be hard to crack.

                    -Also the hardware required is far more specialized than the average laptop

                2. What’s to stop someone from simply going back and editing existing blocks?

                    - Each block is securely hashed—meaning it is rendered into seeming gibberish and nearly impossible to invert or undo

                    

                    

                    Now, Blockchains and crytocurrencies have caused such a stir over the past years. 

                   However,  It seems that theirreal importance hasnt been fully realised yet.
