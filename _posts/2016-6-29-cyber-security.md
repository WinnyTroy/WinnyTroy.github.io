CYBER SECURITY

Each day before leaving our homes, we protect the property within. By
locking our doors, closing our windows, or activating our security
systems, we go to great lengths to ensure that our homes have the
necessary safeguards in place to capture
potential intruders and those who may try to steal our personal and
precious belongings.

When it comes to our confidential personal information, however, many of
us fail to realize that this information is readily available and
able to be hacked at a momentâ€™s notice. Just like the locks on our
homes protect the very livelihood we hold dear, we must take decisive
action to protect ourselves and our personal information from the
burdensome ramifications of a cyber attack. Although many of us are
aware of the dangers that could result from sharing information with
others, we often lack the knowledge that we need to protect ourselves
and our families.

In this fast-paced, digital age, nearly everything we do is connected to
a computer and the internet, including our communications, our
entertainment, transportation, shopping, banking, and even our
medical histories and prescriptions. Through technological advances,
we are able to send and receive more information than ever before -
sometimes - in mere seconds. The amount of information about us that
is available on-line grows each day as our families, friends,
employers, banks, doctors, schools and other contacts depend on
electronic data. Access to this abundance of information requires
great responsibility on our part as consumers and has focused new
importance on the field of Cyber Security.

Cyber Security is the practice of protecting our electronic data by
preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber attacks. With each
convenience that technology has brought into our lives, the level of
inconvenience has also been elevated by making it easier for hackers
to obtain our personal and private records, and in turn, making it
more difficult for us to prevent it from occurring. Simply
withdrawing money from an ATM, electronically filing our taxes, or
refilling a prescription online can put us at risk for being hacked.
With several recent and high profile examples of cyber attacks, we
have all become more aware of this growing problem and,
unfortunately, become either a victim or know someone who has
experienced this rising epidemic of crime.

In response to the severity of this issue, The May 20th hearing
thoroughly examined what our State is doing to prevent cyber attacks
that could affect our security, our economy, and our government.
Hopefully
people soon come to realise the essentiality of protecting our data.
This new generation of ours greatly depends on It.
