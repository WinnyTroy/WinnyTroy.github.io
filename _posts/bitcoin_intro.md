What exactly is Bitcoin

Lemme break It down in the simplest of  definitions, for everybody to understand:
Image we were sitting on a park bench. I had an apple, but you didnt and I wanted to give you my apple.
I would just hand it to you...right?...no complications occured..right?, no involvement of other people like Eve(the local judge) 
who I would have to pull out of the law courts in order to mediate over the transactions...right?
and just like that, our  physical transaction would have concluded.

Now, what if i had a digital apple that I wanted to give you?...afew complications would occur in our transactions.
And we had a digital ledger that we would use in order to track transactions.
And this digital ledger existed in its own world, and had someone to control it.

Alot of questions would be asked like:

    1. what if the one who controlled the ledger created afew more fectitious digital apples? 

        - He could just add a couple of digital apples to his balance whenever he wants!

    2.It isnt like on the bench the other day, just me and you. This time, we have introduced some new party

        -How can I just hand over my digital apple to you in the usual way?

    3.Is there any way to closely replicate our park bench transaction digitally

    

The best way of coming to this problem is: 
    -Or as experts came to see after a minute of deciding, 
    

Why dont we give this form to everybody  it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples, will be recorded in it.
You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody else in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat.
We would just make it open source for all developers to get a chance to view certain details and ammend it.
You could participate in this network too – updating the ledger and making sure it all checks out. 
For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.

This named system does exist. It is called The Bitcoin Protocol.

What does the public ledger enable?

   1) It’s open source, remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. 

       I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited (scarce).

   2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. 

       I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.

    3) Because it’s a public ledger, I didn’t need Eve (third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…

        Within the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. 

It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket.
Just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me , we didn’t need Eve there to make it valid.
Really cool features of this Bitcoin Protocol include:

    1. I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.

    2.I can make other digital things ride on these digital apples ie, I can send texts(digital notes)
